  <h3>Simplify</h3>
  <p class="small">Weniger, aber besser (Dieter Rams)</p>
  <p>Simplifying is not about sacrificing, it’s about becoming more intentional. It’s about making space for the things that truly matter to you.</p>

  <h3>Consume less, create more</h3>
  <p class="small">بالشعب و للشعب Bil-shaʿb wa lil-shaʿb</p>
  <p>Not about living in the past, not about rejecting the future, it’s about being in the present.
  <p>Why make? Because it feels good!</p>
  <p>Consumption: not just buying behaviour, but your information diet, what you allow into your home and life. Consuming less leads to simplicity.</p>

  <h3>Less, but better</h3>
  <p class="small">Weniger, aber besser (Dieter Rams)</p>
  <p>Strive for simplicity: remove the excess and eliminate the things that don’t serve you so you can fully engage and enjoy.</p>
  <p>Curate your life, create a home you love and surround yourself with only things you feel good about</p>
  <p>Use your dollars to support people that act in alignment with your values.</p>
  <p>Support local makers, ecopreneurs and people that are participating in creating a positive world. </p>

  <h3>Progress, not perfection</h3>
  <p class="small">There’s a crack in everything. That’s how the light gets in. (Leonard Cohen)</p>
  <p>Perfection is not the goal - that’s a distraction</p>
  <p>It’s potentially damaging to your health and wellness</p>
  <p>Be comfortable with progress</p>
  <p>Progress means you’re growing as a person</p>
  <p>Never want to present myself as someone who has achieved a green life - I’m also on a journey</p>
